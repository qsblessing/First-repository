Hi, I'm Q!
I'm currently learning to program — I don’t know much yet, but I’m very interested and motivated to improve.

A little about me:

  ✰ I enjoy editing videos and listening to music.
  ✰ I have 3 cats and I kinda love them <3
  ✰ I speak Spanish and English, and I’m also learning French and German.
  ✰ I'm really interested in Asian cultures and I’d love to travel to countries like Japan, South Korea, and China someday.
